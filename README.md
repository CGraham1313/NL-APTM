# NL-APTM
This Program is Written in Java.
This program is designed to take phylogenetic tree files (such as .tree and .nwk), take the GCF and GCA accessions out, search them in the NCBI database, find the name and strain designation, the total genome length, and percent GC and put all of the data into a CSV file for easy viewing. it can also swap the accession ID with the name and strain designation in the original tree file, allowing for the easy renaming of said tree file. 

I hope you enjoy and let me know of any issues!
